# Unreal Engine Image Upload Server
Welcome to the server-side repository for the Unreal Engine Image Upload Tutorial! This repository contains the server application designed to work in tandem with the Unreal Engine project, facilitating the uploading and processing of images sent from the Unreal Engine client using the VaRest plugin and a bit of C++.

# Overview
This server is tailored to receive image data from the Unreal Engine client, process it, and perform any required server-side actions. It's a critical part of the tutorial that demonstrates a full end-to-end process of image handling in game development scenarios.

# Features
Image Reception: Capable of handling HTTP requests with image data from the Unreal Engine client.
Data Processing: Includes logic for processing and storing received image data.
Response Handling: Sends appropriate responses back to the client, confirming receipt and processing status.
